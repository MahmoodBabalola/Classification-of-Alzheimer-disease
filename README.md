Classification Of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease At Early Stage Using Feature Selection And Classification Technique
The analysis for this research was performed using Markdown in R. This research employed a machine learning predictive model, which was trained with a few variables, with the goal of developing an early and cost-effective method for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease. Early detection is crucial in the development of drugs to treat the disease, making the proposed model an important tool in the fight against Alzheimer's.
